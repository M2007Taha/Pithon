# πthon: A Mathematical Calculator for Pi Day and Beyond

#### Description:

πthon (pronounced "pie-thon") is a user-friendly Python application designed to perform various mathematical calculations, making it a valuable tool for students, educators, and anyone interested in exploring mathematical concepts. It's particularly well-suited for Pi Day celebrations, providing a fun and interactive way to engage with the fascinating world of pi.

#### Functionality

πthon offers a range of mathematical functions, including:

Factorials: Calculate the factorial of a number.
Fibonacci Sequence: Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
Trigonometry: Compute sine, cosine, tangent, and cotangent of an angle in degrees or radians.
Exponentiation: Raise a base to a given exponent.
Absolute Value: Determine the absolute value of a number.
Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM): Find the GCD and LCM of two numbers.
The application features a clear and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that simplifies user interaction with these functions.

#### Usage

Interface Overview: The application window consists of several tabs, each dedicated to a specific mathematical operation.
Input Fields: Enter the required values (e.g., numbers, angles) in the designated input fields within each tab.
Buttons: Click the corresponding buttons (e.g., "Calculate") to trigger the calculations.
Output Fields: The results of the calculations will be displayed in the corresponding output fields within each tab.
Clear Button: Use the "Clear" button (if available) to erase previous results and start fresh within a tab.
#### Pi Day Fun

πthon is ideal for Pi Day celebrations! You can use it to:

Calculate pi to a specific number of decimal places.
Explore the Fibonacci sequence and its relationship with the golden ratio.
Investigate trigonometric functions and their applications.
Experiment with various mathematical concepts in a visually appealing and interactive way.
